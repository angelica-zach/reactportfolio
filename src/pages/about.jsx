                  Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate individual who
                  embarked on a journey into web development following my
                  graduation from the<b> University of Warwick</b> with a degree
                  in <b>Electrical and Electronic Engineering</b>
                  . While my academic background provided me with a strong
                  analytical foundation, I craved an outlet for my creativity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Web development quickly captured my interest, offering the
                  perfect blend of <b>creative expression</b> and{" "}
                  <b>technical skills</b>. I discovered that it provided me with
                  the opportunity to exercise control over the visual design of
                  websites, ensuring they not only looked{" "}
                  <b>aesthetically pleasing</b> but also{" "}
                  <b>functioned seamlessly</b>. This resonated with me deeply,
                  as I had long been fascinated by the principles outlined in
                  "The Design of Everyday Things", a book that influenced my
                  perspective on design and usability.
                  <br />
                  Outside of the digital realm, you'll often find me indulging
                  in various hobbies, from crocheting new outfits to
                  experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I also find
                  solace in activities that promote mindfulness and well-being,
                  such as practicing pilates or immersing myself in nature
                  during walks (usually accompanied by a podcast).
